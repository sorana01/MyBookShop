# About
This project uses Java 18. The user creates an account, that can have the following roles: Client, Manager or Courier. 
From the Manager page, you can add, delete or edit books. A manager can also see the orders placed by the clients and accept or reject them. (Once a client places an order, it is not yet ready to be sent to the courier, unless the manager "accepts" the order.
From the Client page, you can see the products in stock, add to cart products, place an order and see your past orders.
From the Courier page, you can see the orders accepted by the manager and choose which ones you want to deliver, by modifying their status from "accepted" to "delivered".
